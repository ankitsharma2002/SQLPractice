SAVEPOINT
Let's use the accounts table from the previous examples. Here, we'll demonstrate a transaction where we create a savepoint, perform some operations, and then roll back to that savepoint if needed.
Step-by-Step Example

Perform some operations
Create a SAVEPOINT
Perform more operations
Roll back to the SAVEPOINT if needed
Commit the transaction if everything is fine
